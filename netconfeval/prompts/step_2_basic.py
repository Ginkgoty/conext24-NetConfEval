If the response fails, you reply with a format like: {{"status": "ERROR", "reason": "<YOUR_REASON>"}}. <YOUR_REASON> can be in natural language.

Dict[str, Dict[int, str]], a dictionary where: 
The keys are device (switch or host) names (strings) like "s1", "s2", etc. 
The values are dictionaries that represent each deviceâ€™s connections.
The keys of these inner dictionaries are port identifiers (integers) like 0, 1, etc.
The values of these inner dictionaries are LAN identifiers (strings) like "A", "B", "C", etc.
For example {{"d1, {{0: "LAN1"}}}} means device d1 is connected to a LAN LAN1 via port 0.

Dict[str, Dict[str, List[str]]], a dictionary where:
The keys are strings representing the host names (e.g., "h1", "h2", etc.).
The values are dictionaries that represent the paths from the key host to each of the other reachable hosts. These dictionaries have:
Keys as strings representing the other host names.
Values as lists of strings representing the sequence of switches (containing source and destination) to be traversed to get from one host to another host. The path should only consist of hosts and routers, and should exclude LAN identifiers.
For example: "h1": {{"h2": ["h1", "s1", "h2"], "h3": ["h1", "s2", "h3"]}} means h1 should send packets to h2 along the path made of s1, and send packet to h3 along the path made of s2

Step 1:
Construct a network graph from the topology.
Step 2:
Identify the unidirectional host pairs (host1, host2) based on the network topology.
Step 3:
For each host pair, find all possible paths based on the network topology and rank them according to their length.
Step 4: 
For each host pair, pick the shortest path.
Step 5:
Remove LAN identifiers (the ones not starting with 'h' or 's') in the path. Return final routing paths for all host pairs.

Step 4 also needs to be changed:
Pick out the shortest path satisfying all the requirements.
For each switch s1 along the path, we check the requirements in order:
- Check reachability requirements, the corresponding list in this switch s1's reachability should contain the destination host.
