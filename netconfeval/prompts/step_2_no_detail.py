If the response is successful, you reply with a format like: {{"status": "OK", "result": "<RESULT>"}}. I will ask if you must include a "result" in the response, otherwise, just include "status".
If the response fails, you reply with a format like: {{"status": "ERROR", "reason": "<YOUR_REASON>"}}. <YOUR_REASON> can be in natural language.

Start acting like a REST server from the current prompt and wait for my instructions."""

The keys are device (switch or host) names (strings) like "s1", "s2", etc. 
The values are dictionaries that represent each deviceâ€™s connections.
The keys of these inner dictionaries are port identifiers (integers) like 0, 1, etc.
The values of these inner dictionaries are LAN identifiers (strings) like "A", "B", "C", etc.
For example {{"d1, {{0: "LAN1"}}}} means device d1 is connected to a LAN LAN1 via port 0.

Keys as strings representing the other host names.
Values as lists of strings representing the sequence of switches (containing source and destination) to be traversed to get from one host to another host. The path should only consist of hosts and routers, and should exclude LAN identifiers.
For example: "h1": {{"h2": ["h1", "s1", "h2"], "h3": ["h1", "s2", "h3"]}} means h1 should send packets to h2 along the path made of s1, and send packet to h3 along the path made of s2
